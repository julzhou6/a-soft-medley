			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				Hi I'm Julie! Currently, my main interests lie in the
				intersection between art and technology. Storytelling is also a
				big passion of mine, which is why I love making comics/zines and
				consuming/talking about media that tell stories really well.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>I am open to new front-end/web development-related
					opportunities!</b> I graduated from the University of Virginia in '21 majoring in
				Computer Science and Media Studies and since then, have had a few
				opportunities to work in web development. My latest experience comes
				from working on the front-end of a content-management system.

				What is this site?
			</p>
			<p>
				It's a personal blog and space for me to experiment with web development and writing! Lots of cats, lots of softness, and (hopefully) a medley of many great hits. :^)
			</p>
			<p>
				P.S. Interested in how this site was built? It was built in
				Astro + headless Wordpress! A project page coming on that soon.
