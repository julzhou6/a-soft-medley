			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				Hi I'm Julie! Currently, my main interests lie in the
				intersection between art and technology. Storytelling is also a
				big passion of mine, which is why I love making comics/zines and
				consuming/talking about media that tell stories really well.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b
					>I am open to new front-end/web development-related
					opportunities!</b
				> I graduated from the University of Virginia in '21 majoring in
				Computer Science and Media Studies and since then, have had a few
				opportunities to work in web development. My latest experience comes
				from working on the front-end of a content-management system.

			<h1>About this Blog</h1>
			<p style="font-style: oblique;">
				What does your site name mean? What is that icon?
			</p>
			<p>
				To put simply, "soft" is for my approach to life -- I like to
				approach everything with gentleness. "Medley" as in a song
				medley because my blog will be a mashup of a lot of different
				things. Lastly, I wanted the site to sound like a bit like a
				book title. An interesting tidbit would be since one of my
				favorite manga is "Fruits Basket" by Natsuki Takaya, I initially
				brainstormed names similar to that (e.g. "fruit medley" haha).
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the icon, the main one is a tangerine in the shape of an
				badly drawn eigth note. I like tangerines and making it a music
				note fit with the "medley" part of the title.
			</p>
			<p>
				Topics that I write about will really vary! For sure, you can
				expect personal pieces, coding projects, anime/manga reviews,
				etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				P.S. Interested in how this site was built? It was built in
				Astro + headless Wordpress! A project page coming on that soon.
